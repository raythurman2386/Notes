## Tell me about yourself.

I started my journey into web development in 2017 while I was attending Indiana University for their CS Program. Around March of 2019 I enrolled into Lambda School and started focusing on building full stack applications with React, Node, and JavaScript.

## What kind of work environment are you looking for in the next opportunity you take?

In my next work environment I am mainly looking for remote opportunities.

## What are your strengths and weaknesses as a developer?

One of my strengths as a developer is the ability to pick up new languages fairly quickly. I first realized this back when I transitioned from learning Python for 2 years in college to learning JavaScript at Lambda School, it was a very easy transition.

A weakness of mine as a developer is not being too proud to reach out for help if needed. I feel like I can figure out the issue I'm having if I just spend a little more time on it. But sometimes
if there is a deadline, that could turn into a potential problem.

## Tell me about a group project that you are passionate about?

I guess you could consider my current side project a group project. I have been working with my kids in developing an application to assist them with studying for school.
We looked around the internet at some of the sites out there and they are typically bloated with adds. So I told them I would start working on something and to give me ideas for
features basically. I pushed out the initial MVP and let my daughter test it and she has been loving it and looking forward to helping add more features.

## Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?

In 3-5 years I see myself as a mid to senior level developer at a successful company providing value by writing and helping debug code.
