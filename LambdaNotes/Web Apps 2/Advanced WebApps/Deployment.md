# Deployment with ZEIT

To start out, please go to `ZEIT` and sign up for an account with your Github profile. Once you do that, move on to the Follow Along section below to learn how to deploy a React app using `ZEIT`.

Setup your account with Github

You’ll then be given the option to install the integration for all of your repositories, or for select repositories. You’ll want to enable this for everything because you always have control over whether or not you want to deploy a repository or not from the ZEIT dashboard

After you install the integration, you’ll be taken back to the onboarding flow where you should see a success message like the one shown below.

Finally, you’ll be taken to the last part of your onboarding process, which is to deploy one of the starter templates. Select the React starter to deploy a create-react-app template.

You’ll then be taken to a page where you can name the project. Feel free to change it to whatever you wish. If you do change the ZEIT project name, it’s a good idea to also change the GitHub repository name to keep things consistent.

GitHub repositories are checked private by default, but its a good idea to uncheck this if you want to share your work with your classmates and instructors.

Upon creating your project, you’ll be taken to the project overview page where you’ll find all your deployments for the project. If you initially see a message that says:

 “No deployments found in this project.”, 
 
ignore that and refresh the page. You should find a URL for your deployment. Click it and you’ll be taken to the deployment overview page, where you can find build logs and runtime logs.

Give your deployment about a minute to finish building and refresh the page. You should see a preview screenshot as well as a READY status. Congratulations on your first deployment! Click on the image preview or the blue Visit button and you’ll be taken to your deployment.
