Pitch: Today, fitness happens everywhere - a park, an unfinished basement, a garage gym, etc.- not just gyms. Certified fitness instructors need an app that takes the awkwardness out of collecting payments from friends and taking attendance.
 
 For the MVP create:
 1. Onboarding for a new client
 2. Onboarding for a fitness instructor
 3. Ability for instructor to create punch pass categories for each type of group fitness class they offer (yoga, insanity, RIPPED, HIGH, pilates, etc.).
 4. Ability to easily create / setup a class time
 5. Ability to easily edit / delete a class
 6. Ability to easily search / find a class
 7. Ability for client to create an account and purchase a 10 class punch pass from an instructor.
 8. Punch pass updates for client as itâ€™s used.
 
 Stretch: Integrate paypal as a payment method. Ability for instructor to add people to a 'class list' and check them in as they arrive.
