---The Box Model
    A pattern for positioning HTML elements on the page using CSS

    Box model is one of the most important skills in front end development
    As style start to get added, the items start to get bigger.

    Margin is the outermost element in the box model
    then comes the Border
    after the border is the padding
    and after the padding is the content itself

    Content- space within the model in which our text and images are rendered
    Padding- the spacing between the content and border
    Border- a border that we can style around the padding
    Margin- the space between the border and the rest of the page.
