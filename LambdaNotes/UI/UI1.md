---HTML5

W3C = World Wide Web Consortium

The W3C uses the word recommended to describe the most up to date standards. 
The word SEMANTIC is used to describe tags with meaning.

Non semantic code will lose out on SEO

h1-h6
p
section
nav
header
footer
aside

We use div tags to create space, add structure or style elements.
Semantic HTML concepts go deeper into search engine optimization.

---CSS3

* Universal Selectors

H1 Element Selector

.class Class Selector

#id Id Selectors

Inline styles

!important

    -Pseudo-Classes

Pseudo classes are used when you may not have a set amount of elements but still want to specifically style them.

More specific than universal, element and class but less specific than ID, inline, or important.

    -CSS Inheritance

CSS inheritance is similar to human inheritance in that you can pass traits down to ancestor elements. In css every ancestor of the original parent will gain access to all the css properties through inheritance. In HTML when an element is placed inside another element it is said to be nested within its parent element.
