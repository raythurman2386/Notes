# React
  React is a powerful unopinionated UI library who's main purpose is to be used to build powerful applications. React uses encapsulated pieces of UI called Components that concern themselves with their own individual pieces of the DOM.

  React uses an engine called the Virtual DOM to update any changes that will be made over time to our applications.
