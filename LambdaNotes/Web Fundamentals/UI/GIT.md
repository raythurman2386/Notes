Git is a version control to help save your work on projects.

The Lambda School Git Flow
    Student will create own version of Repo (fork)
    Student will add PM as a collaborator
    student will then Clone the Repo
    Student will then create a branch git checkout -b 'raymond-thurman'
    Student will then submit their PR into the new branch
        student will use their own student fork as the base
        student will add PM as reviewer on the pull request
    PM will then count the HW as done by merging the HW into master Student Fork

    fork repo -> clone repo -> git checkout -b 'raymond-thurman' -> git push -u origin raymond-thurman 

---PULL REQUESTS
    Submits your changes to the master repo
    used in Lambda to turn your projects in.
