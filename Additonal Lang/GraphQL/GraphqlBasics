# GraphQL Basics

A GraphQL server provides a client with a predefined _schema_

- schema - A model of the data that can be requested from the server

in other words, the schema serves as a middle ground between the client and the server while defining how to access the data.

Written down in Schema Definition Language (SDL), basic components of a GraphQL schema -- _types_ -- 

- types - describe kinds of object that can be queried on that server and the fields they have.

The schema defines what queries are allowed to be made, what types of data can be fetched, and the relationships between these types.
You can create a GraphQL schema and build an interface around it with any programming language.

Having the schema before querying, a client can validate their query against it to make sure the server
will be able to respond to the query. While the shape of a GraphQL query closely matches the result, 
you can predict what will be returned. This eliminates such unwelcome surprises
as unavailable data or a wrong structure.

## Three main operations:
- Query: reading data
- Mutation: writing data
- Subscription: automatically receiving real-time data over time.
