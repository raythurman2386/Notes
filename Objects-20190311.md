!!!OBJECTS!!!

Object oriented programming is a set of techniques that use objects as the central principle of program organization.

---ENCAPSULATION

Separating interface from implementation.
divide programs into smaller pieces and make each piece responsible for managing its own state.

---METHODS

nothing more than properties that hold function values. ex:

let rabbit = {};
rabbit.speak = function(line){
console.log(`The rabbit says ${line}`);
}

rabbit.speak("I'm alive.");
// The rabbit says "I'm alive."

Usually a method needs to do something with the object it was called on. When a function is called as a method, looked up as a property and immediately called, as in object.method(), the binding called THIS in its body automatically points at the object that it was called on.
