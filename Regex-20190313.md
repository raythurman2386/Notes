---REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

Regular expressions are a type of object. It can either be constructed with the RegExp constructor (let re1 = new RexExp("abc");) or written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in forward slash (/) characters.

Regular expressions have a number of different methods. The simplest one is TEST. if you pass it a string, it will return a boolean value telling you whether the string contains a match of the pattern in the expression.

---COMMON CHARACTER GROUPS

\d = Any digit character
\w = An alphanumeric character
\s = any whitespace character
\D = A character that is not a digit
\W = A nonalphanumeric character
\S = A nonwhitespace character
.  = Any character except for a newline

To invert a set of characters (express that you want to match any character except the ones in the set) you can write a caret (^) character after the opening bracket.
