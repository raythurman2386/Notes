1. Finish the tutorial, add to it, change it, customize the style and experiment to grasp the concepts and slowly start to add more difficult features.

2. Build something new, use the principals that you learned to create something different. Mix and match from different tutorials.

3. Research the docs, stack overflow, other projects and DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP. Struggle will make the concepts stick.

4. Use some alternate resources, conference talks, help videos, live streams, articles and podcasts.

5. Talk to other developers, talk through discord, slack, stack overflow, contribute to open source projects. PAIR PROGRAMMING

6. Attempt to help others with questions and problems that they are having themself.

Quick summary of my advice to new software people, on how to be better:

1. Make a habit of coding things FROM SCRATCH, or coding simpler versions of complex things, for deeper insight. Most beginners just read code and think they get it. They really don't understand, unless they've coded things from scratch, on a blank screen.

2. Code daily. Beginners usually don't practice enough to be good or fast enough for a company. A company expects you to finish a typical task (fixing a bug or building a new feature) in 1-3 days. Your GitHub page should be full of green squares, showing regular code commits. If you don't know GitHub learn and get used to using it daily.

3. Get used to playing around with each new software idea or function. Tear it apart to see how it works. Change inputs and change the algorithms to see how different code affects results. Solve the same problem in different ways and time their performance. Be able to talk about why you made certain code decisions, their Big O time/space complexities, and pros/cons of each software decision.

4. Much of working in software teams feels like being a lawyer, because we're often asked tough questions, by critical managers or coworkers, on why we coded things the way we did. We must have done enough testing and thought through alternative solutions enough to clearly, strongly defend our coding decisions.

5. Practice SPEAKING about your code, out loud. Practice teaching it to newbies. Be able to easily, clearly, and persuasively teach each part of it and defend your decisions, line by line, to an imaginary student sitting beside you.

I have tons of more advice, but these qualities are what I often see lacking in beginners.

6. Write software tests. Try to make your code fail in every possible way before releasing it to the public. Think of everything that can go wrong, then write tests for every case. Most beginners never test their code.

7. Get used to reading senior engineers' code and stealing their tricks. Most beginners only read their own code. They don't make a habit of reading senior code.

8. Make open source contributions to popular projects on GitHub. This is the most valuable way you can get software experience, next to actually working a paid software job. Employers love open source contributions because it's as close as possible as you can get to daily software work.
