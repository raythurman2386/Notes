FRONTEND MASTERS ADVANCED CSS LAYOUTS

This is the repository for all of the exercise files required to follow along with the Frontend Masters course "Advanced CSS Layouts."

Remaining exercise materials are at CodePen: https://codepen.io/collection/nZEYgP/

Before watching this course, it is expected that you have a working knowledge of semantic HTML and CSS. You should already know a bit about Flexbox as well.

If you do not have a background in Flexbox and/or CSS Grid, watch my previous course, "CSS Grid and Flexbox for Responsive Design," https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/

If you do not have a background in CSS, watch Estelle Weyl's course, "CSS In Depth": https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-in-depth-v2/
