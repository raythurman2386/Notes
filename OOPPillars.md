# Four Pillars of OOP

1. Abstraction

- Hiding internal details and showing functionality
- We can access our smartphone but may not know how the internals work

2. Encapsulation

- Wrapping, binding all code and data together
- State of the object and behavior all in one
- Fields are kept private and accessed through methods

3. Polymorphism

- Poly = many, morph = form
- Use the same word with different meanings
- Method overloading: same method with different parameters resulting in different behaviors
- Method overriding: a child can implement a method differently than the parent

4. Inheritance

- A new class can adopt the properties from another class
- The original class is called the parent or cuperclass
- the new class is called the child or subclass
