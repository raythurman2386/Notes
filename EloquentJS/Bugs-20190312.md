# Chapter 8 Bugs

---STRICT MODE
JavaScript can be made slightly more strict by enabling strict mode. You do this by adding "use strict" at the top of a file or function body.
ex.

    function canYouSpotTheProblem(){
        "use strict";
        for(counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++){
            console.log("Hello");
        }
    }
    // Throws ReferenceError: counter is not defined

---TESTING
Tests are programs that verify some aspect of your code
For example, a set of tests for the toUpperCase method:

    function test(label, body){
        if(!body()) console.log(`Failed: ${label}`);
    }
    test("convert Latin text to uppercase", () => {
        return "hello".toUpperCase() == "HELLO";
    });
    test("convert Greek text to uppercase", () => {
        return "Xaipete".toUpperCase() == "XAIPETE";
    });

---DEBUGGING

---EXCEPTIONS
When a function cannot proceed normally, what we would like to do is just stop what we are doing and immediately jump to a place that knows how to handle the problem. 

---ASSERTIONS   
Assertions are checks inside a program that verify that something is the way it is supposed to be. They are used not to handle situations that can come up in normal operation but to find programmer mistakes.
